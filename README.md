# Task 1: Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning
In this regression task I tried to predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.  This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. 

# Task 2: Prediction using Unsupervised Machine Learning
In this task,it is required to predict the optimum number of cluster for the Iris data set. Iris data set consists of 3 types of flower namely Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolour and Iris-virginica.
